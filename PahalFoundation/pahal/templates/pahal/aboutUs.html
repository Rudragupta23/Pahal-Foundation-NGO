                <p>At Pahal Foundation, we believe that every child deserves a chance to dream, learn, and grow, regardless of their background. Founded with a vision to bridge the gap between privilege and need, Pahal Foundation is dedicated to supporting underprivileged children, especially those from the families of daily wage workers and marginalized communities.</p>

                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>Our mission is simple yet powerfulâ€”to ensure that no child is deprived of education, essential clothing, and the basic necessities that every child deserves. We aim to break the cycle of poverty through quality education, skill development, and holistic support.</p>

                <p>We envision a society where children are not defined by their circumstances but by their dreams and potential. Our goal is to create an environment where education is a right, not a privilege, and where every child feels seen, heard, and valued.</p>

                <h2>Why We Exist</h2>
                <p>We exist because millions of children in India face barriers to education, nutrition, and basic healthcare. Without intervention, these children often fall into cycles of poverty, making it difficult for them to escape their circumstances. At Pahal Foundation, we strive to provide a pathway for these children to access education, build skills, and create a better future for themselves and their families.</p>
